# Notes on the Reproduction

## What This Reproduces

This repository demonstrates a build failure that occurs when using:
- Alchemy plugin with React Router 7
- Rolldown-vite as the bundler
- cloudflare:workers imports in middleware
- Strict peer dependency resolution (Bun with peer=false)

## Current Behavior

### Local Build (macOS, Bun 1.3.0)
- ❌ **FAILS** with current Alchemy configuration
- Error: `Rolldown failed to resolve import "cloudflare:workers"`

### Expected CI Behavior
- ❌ **FAILS** with Alchemy plugin
- Error may manifest as:
  1. Missing "./v4/core" specifier in "zod" package
  2. Failed to resolve "cloudflare:workers" import

## Key Files

- `apps/frontend/vite.config.ts` - Contains both Alchemy and Cloudflare plugin configs
- `apps/frontend/app/middleware/toast.server.ts` - Uses cloudflare:workers import
- `bunfig.toml` - Strict peer dependency resolution configuration
- `nx.json` - Minimal Nx configuration for workspace orchestration

## To Test Different Configurations

Edit `apps/frontend/vite.config.ts` and switch between:

1. **Alchemy (current)** - Commented out, shows working state
2. **Cloudflare** - Uncomment cloudflare() plugin

## Building

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build workspace package
cd packages/toast && bun run build && cd ../..

# Build frontend app (will fail with Alchemy config)
cd apps/frontend && bun react-router build
```

## What Changed from Original Request

Added:
- `nx.json` - Minimal Nx configuration
- `wrangler.json` - Required for Cloudflare plugin
- `app/entry.server.tsx` - Server entry point for React Router
- Fixed `tsconfig.json` - Removed extends that caused resolution issues

The reproduction successfully demonstrates a build failure that may manifest differently in CI environments.
